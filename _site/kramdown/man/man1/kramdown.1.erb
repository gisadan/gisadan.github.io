.TH "KRAMDOWN" 1 "June 2014"
.SH NAME
kramdown \- a fast, pure-Ruby Markdown-superset converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kramdown
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fIFILE\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
kramdown is primarily used for parsing a superset of Markdown and converting it to different output
formats. It supports standard Markdown (with some minor modifications) and various extensions like
tables and definition lists. Due to its modular architecture it also allows other input formats than
Markdown, for example, HTML or Github Flavored Markdown.

If \fIFILE\fR is not specified, kramdown reads from the standard input. The result is written to the
standard output.

There are two sets of options that kramdown accepts: The first one includes the options that are
used directly by the kramdown binary. The second set of options controls how kramdown parses and
converts its input.
