compatible with stylesheets designed for Pygments.

To use Rouge, set the option ['syntax_highlighter'](../options.html#option-syntax-highlighter) to

Rubygems by running `gem install rouge`.

The Rouge syntax highlighter supports the following keys of the option
['syntax_highlighter_opts'](../options.html#option-syntax-highlighter-opts):
