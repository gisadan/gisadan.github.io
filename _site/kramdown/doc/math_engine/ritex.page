## Math Engine Ritex

Ritex converts TeX math formulas into MathML and can be used together with the [HTML
converter](../converter/html.html).

To use Ritex, set the option ['math_engine'](../options.html#option-math-engine) to
'ritex' and make sure that Ritex is available. The Ritex library can be installed, e.g., via
Rubygems by running `gem install ritex`.

> Note that Ritex is released under the GNU GPL version 2 which means that when you use it in
> conjunction with kramdown and your application, your application will automatically also fall under
> the GNU GPL!
>
> If this is a problem for you, consider using the [itex2MML engine](itex2mml.html) instead!
